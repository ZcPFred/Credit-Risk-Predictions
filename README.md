# Credit-Risk-Prediction
## Description
The aim is to predict the likelihood of borrowers experiencing financial distressâ€”specifically, becoming 90 days or more overdue on loan payments within a two-year period.  A set of classification models including KNN,Random Forest, GradientBoosting, AdaBoost,and XGBoost has been trained, tuned, and evaluated with a 5-fold cross validation.

## Introduction
The dataset provided comprises approximately 250,000 anonymized borrower records, totaling around 15MB in size. This data is divided into a training set of 150,000 entries (10,026 is positive and 139,974 is negative) and a test set containing 101,503 entries.Each record includes 11 variables: one target variable, "SeriousDlqin2yrs," indicating whether the borrower experienced 90 days past due delinquency or worse , and 10 predictor variables offering various financial and demographic insights.

The data contains no categorical feature except for the target variable. Supervised classification model is the natural approach.KNN and Logistic Regression will be used as baseline model, and more advanced approach like Random Forest and three Boosting models will be trained.

Below shows the distribution of each features. Age is approximately normally distributed. NumberOfOpenCreditLinesAndLoans, NumberRealEstateLoansOrLines,and NumberOfDependents are right skewed. The rest of the features are influenced by outliers/extreme values, and therefore not showing obvious distribution pattern.
![Distribution](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f14d32f3-e3c8-4e6d-ab14-d666a71efccd)

Correlation Analysis among features reflect that NumberOfTime30-59DaysPastDueNotWorse, 60-89DaysPastDueNotWorse, and NumberOfTimes90DaysLate are highly correlated (0.98-0.99), the rest of the variables are not obviusly correlated. While performing feature importance analysis is a regular approach to handel highly correlated variables, the set of algorithms we choose (not considering baseline models) are fairly robust to multicollinearity, so no further processing implemented for now.
![Correlation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb41f54e-17b5-45c2-b95e-d1e4bb4af82a)

The target variable is highly imbalanced.Only 6.7% of the data is positive, 93.3% are negative, which is very intuitive because you would expect defaulting will be a relative rare case. The imbalanced data means that accuracy will not be a good metric to evaluate model performence, AUC, Recall, Precision, and F1-Score will be used instead.

### Missing Value Processing
The MonthlyIncome feature contains 29,731 missing values (19.8% of the training data).The NumberOfDependents feature had 3924 missing values (2.6% of the training data). From the visulizations generated by Missingno, it seems the missig values in these two features are randomly distributed. And the missing value correlation analysis shows no obvious correlation between the missed values and the rest of the features. These indicates that the missing values in these two features is likely to be MAR (Missing At Random), and therefore median imputation has been implemented, taking the fact that these two features both influenced by outliers into consideration.

### Outlier Processing

The boxplots may not be very intuitive for this data as most of the features contains fair amount of extreme values, but it can provide a overview for possible outliers.

![Boxplot](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88b0b8e4-a785-4473-9c27-f6e62fb6faec)

Outlier detection has been implemented using Z statistics, IQR, and percentile based approach. To ensure it is safe to conclude some extreme values are in fact outliers, a deeper analysis to look into each features' extreme values has been implemented too. 

A few features worth to mention:

      The Age feature contains obvious outliers on one 0 years old person becuase its very unlikely a person with age of 0  will have 6000 monthly 
      income and at the same time hold debt. The outlier is replaced by median.
   
      The NumberOfDependents feature contains one obvious outliers on a person that has 20 dependents.The outlier is replaced by median.
   
      The NumberOfTimes90DaysLate feature contains obvious outliers on values of 96 and 98, which largely deviated to the rest of the data.The outlier 
      is replaced by median.

The median imputation is implemented for outliers. It might looks more reasonable to apply Winsorization method which replace the outliers with the closest values remained. But because each features contains a fair amount of extreme values (not outliers), it is safer to use median imputation to maintain the feature's original distribution.

### Result

A 5-fold cross validation has been implemented to evaluated the AUC performance of each models with default hyperparameter setting
| Model                      | AUC         | Std       |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| LogisticRegression         | 0.773081521 | 0.0028122 |
| RandomForestClassifier     | 0.838451575 | 0.0064946 |
| KNeighborsClassifier       | 0.562682172 | 0.0017793 |
| GradientBoostingClassifier | 0.864233168 | 0.0024135 |
| AdaBoostClassifier         | 0.857671494 | 0.0024582 |
| XGBClassifier              | 0.854376363 | 0.0031092 |

From the table above it is obvious that the three boosting model have the best average performance. These three models are chosen to proceed with hyperparameter tuning using gridsearch, and the roc curve and confusion matrix are plotted with the tuned hyperparameters.

## Conclusion

|           | GradientBoostingClassifier | XGBClassifier | AdaBoostClassifier |
| --------- | -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| AUC       | 0.8653                     | 0.8651        | 0.8602             |
| Precision | 0.21                       | 0.2           | 0.2                |
| Recall    | 0.77                       | 0.79          | 0.79               |
| F1-Score  | 0.34                       | 0.32          | 0.32               |

Overall GradientBoosting performed the best on AUC, precision, and F1-Score, XGBoost has very close AUC score, similar F1-Score and Precision score,  and better Recall score comparing to GradientBoosting. In conclusion, if AUC is chosen as the metric to evaluate models then choose GradientBoosting, if Recall is chosen as the metric to evaluate models then choose XGBoost. It is also worth to mention that the training time required for XGboost is significantly less than the GradientBoosting.
